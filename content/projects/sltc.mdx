# SLTC E-commerce Platform

## üõí Overview

The SLTC E-commerce Platform is a full-stack solution designed to streamline the sales process for businesses. It consists of two main components:

1. A Django-powered e-commerce website with a custom admin panel
2. A Flutter-based Android application for salesmen to take orders from business owners

This integrated system provides a seamless experience for both administrators and sales teams, enhancing efficiency and order management.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **E-commerce Website**:
  - User-friendly product browsing and ordering system
  - Secure payment integration
  - Custom admin panel for inventory and order management
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile users

- **Android Application**:
  - Offline capability for salesmen in areas with poor connectivity
  - Real-time synchronization with the main database when online
  - Easy-to-use interface for quick order placement
  - Product catalog with up-to-date information

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Website Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Website Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Android App**: Flutter
- **API**: Django REST Framework
- **Version Control**: Git

## üîç How It Works

1. **Admin Panel**: Business owners manage products, inventory, and view orders through the custom Django admin interface.
2. **E-commerce Website**: Customers browse products and place orders online.
3. **Android App**: Salesmen use the app to showcase products and take orders from business owners in person.
4. **Synchronization**: Orders placed through the app are synced with the main database when an internet connection is available.
