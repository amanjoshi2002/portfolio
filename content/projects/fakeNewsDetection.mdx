Our Fake News Detection app combines a Flutter frontend with a Flask backend to create a powerful tool for combating misinformation. This project leverages machine learning to analyze news articles and provide users with real-time authenticity assessments.

## Key Features

- Interactive Flutter-based frontend with draggable elements
- Flask backend with integrated machine learning model
- Clipboard integration for easy text analysis
- Real-time API communication between frontend and backend
- User-friendly manual entry and issue reporting options

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (specify as appropriate)
- **API Communication**: HTTP package (Flutter), Flask-RESTful (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite (or your chosen database)

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

### Frontend Setup (Flutter)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/amanjoshi2002/fakenewsdetection.git
   cd fake-news-detection/frontend
   ```

2. Install Flutter dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

### Backend Setup (Flask)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd ../backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the database:
   ```
   flask db upgrade
   ```

5. Run the Flask server:
   ```
   flask run
   ```

### Connecting Frontend to Backend

1. Open `lib/config.dart` in the Flutter project.
2. Update the `API_URL` to match your Flask server

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your device or emulator.
2. Use the draggable arrow on the front page to access the main features.
3. Activate the bubble overlay for quick access to news analysis.
4. Paste text from your clipboard or use manual entry to analyze news articles.
5. View the AI-powered prediction on the authenticity of the news.
6. Report any issues or potential fake news articles through the app.
